/*
389. Find the Difference

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
